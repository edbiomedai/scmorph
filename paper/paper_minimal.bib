  abstract = {In single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), gene expression is assessed individually for each cell, allowing the investigation of developmental processes, such as embryogenesis and cellular differentiation and regeneration, at unprecedented resolutions. In such dynamic biological systems, grouping cells into discrete groups is not reflective of the biology. Cellular states rather form a continuum, e.g., for the differentiation of stem cells into mature cell types. This process is often represented via a trajectory in a reduced-dimensional representation of the scRNA-seq dataset. While many methods have been suggested for trajectory inference, it is often unclear how to handle multiple biological groups or conditions, e.g., inferring and comparing the differentiation trajectories of wild-type and knock-out stem cell populations. In this manuscript, we present a method for the estimation and downstream interpretation of cell trajectories across multiple conditions. Our framework allows the interpretation of differences between conditions at the trajectory, cell population, and gene expression levels. We start by integrating datasets from multiple conditions into a single trajectory. By comparing the conditions along the trajectory's path, we can detect large-scale changes, indicative of differential progression. We also demonstrate how to detect subtler changes by finding genes that exhibit different behaviors between these conditions along a differentiation path.},

  abstract = {Systematic measurement biases make normalization~an essential step in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis. There may be multiple competing considerations behind the assessment of normalization performance, of which some may be study specific. We have developed ``scone''--- a flexible framework for assessing performance based on a comprehensive panel of data-driven metrics. Through graphical summaries and quantitative reports, scone summarizes trade-offs and ranks large numbers of normalization methods by panel performance. The method is implemented in the open-source Bioconductor R software package scone. We show that top-performing normalization~methods lead to better agreement with independent validation~data for a collection of scRNA-seq datasets. scone can be downloaded at http://bioconductor.org/packages/scone/.},
