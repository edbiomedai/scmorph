scmorph
========

Single-cell morphological analysis
----------------------------------

scmorph is a **Python library** to process **CellPainting** or any morphological data. It unlocks single-cell data to model heterogenity.

scmorph differs from the popular `pyCytominer <https://github.com/cytomining/pycytominer>`_ package in the following ways:

* **Single-cell**\ : Enables efficient analysis of single-cell data
* **Batch-correction**\ : Natively integrates a `batch correction technique <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2019.03.010>`_ widely used for scRNA-seq.
* **Enhanced feature selection**\ : Removes non-linearly correlated features using an adapted `Chatterjee correlation coefficient <https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2108.06828>`_, which results in fewer, more meaningful features.
* **Enhanced aggregation**\ : Offers statistically robust aggregation methods to derive meaningful distances to a control sample.

It provides tools to make single-cell data analysis easier and more reproducible. For example, it can be used to:

* Load in data from csv files, e.g. generated by CellProfiler.
* Remove batch effects to compare conditions across batches.
* QC both cells and images.
* Remove redundant features based on correlation.
* Reduce dimensionality to gain quick intuition about the data's spread.
* Perform statistically robust aggregate analysis to quickly identify hits.


Installation
------------

Install scmorph via pip:

``pip install git+https://github.com/edbiomedai/scmorph``
